# Requires the latest version of Docker Compose.
# Docker Compose V2 is recommended.
# `docker-compose.yaml` files cannot use shell outputs as their inputs.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3
# and https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md
# for details concerning the `docker-compose.yaml` file syntax.
# Variables are in ${VARIABLE:-DEFAULT_VALUE} format
# to ensure that default values are given to the Dockerfile.
# Using a `.env` file to set variables is strongly recommended.
# Run `make env` to create a basic `.env` file with the UID and GID variables.
# Compute Capability must be specified manually via the `CCA` variable.

# Using a `docker-compose.yaml` file has many advantages
# over creating custom shell scripts for each project.
# The settings are much easier to see and maintain than scattered shell scripts.
# Also, Compose is a native Docker component, simplifying project maintenance.
