# Requires the Docker Compose V2.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3
# and https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md
# for details concerning the `docker-compose.yaml` file syntax.

# Variables are in ${VARIABLE:-DEFAULT_VALUE} format
# to ensure that default values are given to the Dockerfile.
# Using a `.env` file to set variables is strongly recommended.

# Run `make env` to create a basic `.env` file with the UID and GID variables.
# Compute Capability must be specified via the `CCA` variable.

# Using a `docker-compose.yaml` file has many advantages
# over creating custom shell scripts for each project.
# The settings are much easier to see and maintain than scattered shell scripts.
# Also, Compose is a native Docker component, simplifying project maintenance.

# Set the host environment variable `BUILDKIT_PROGRESS=plain` to see the full build log.

# See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html for an
# explanation of how to specify the `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` variable.
# The variable `CCA` is used to specify `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`.
