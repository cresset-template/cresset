# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1
# The top line is used by BuildKit. _**DO NOT ERASE IT**_.

# See the link below for documentation on BuildKit syntax.
# https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/syntax.md
# Perhaps the BuildKit dependency is not a good idea since not everyone can use it.
# However, the Dockerfile in the official PyTorch repository also uses BuildKit.

# This image uses multi-stage builds. See the link below for a detailed description.
# https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build
# The build process is similar to a neural network with complicated control flow.
# The `stages` are like blocks in the network, with control flow implemented
# by the names of arguments and stages. This allows muh greater modularity in the build.
# It also makes the final image much more compact and efficient.

# All `ARG` variables must be redefined for every stage,
# `ARG`s defined before `FROM` transfer their values to layers that redefine them.
# `ENV` and `LABEL` variables are inherited only by child stages.
# See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder on how to write Dockerfiles and
# https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices
# for best practices.

# Style guide: variables specified in the Dockerfile are written as ${ARGUMENT}
# while variables not specified by ARG/ENV are written as $ARGUMENT.

# See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html for an
# explanation of how to specify the `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` variable.

# See https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda for all CUDA images.
# Default image is nvidia/cuda:11.3.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04.
# Magma version must match the CUDA version of the build image.

# cuDNN minor version is tied to CUDA minor version.
# See documentation below for available versions.
